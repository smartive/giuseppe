TODO:

The new version should be a pluggable system. So a plugin should deliver the following 4 elements:

- A list of Return-Type registrations (register a handler for a certain type, exception: Promise)
- A list of ParamDecorators that are registered in giuseppe
- A list of RouteDecorators that are registered in giuseppe
- A list of Route/Controller Modificators that are registered in giuseppe

A route decorator does ultimately create a route (like @Get) and a modificator does change the behaviour
(like @Version).

same name -> exception.

route / controller modificators:
pre route hook
post route hook
route ID -> to check if duplicates are registered.
