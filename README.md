> [Italian: dʒuˈzɛppe]

A controller routing system for expressJS with typescript decorators and annotations.
Named after Giuseppe Verdi the great componist. Like Verdi, we compose things, 
but not a great piece of art! We compose routes for you. `giuseppe` is dedicated to
[expressJS](http://expressjs.com/) and depends on it. We were tired of writting all the
route registrations by ourselfes.
