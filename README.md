giuseppe [Italian: dʒuˈzɛppe] is a controller routing system for [Express](http://expressjs.com/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
decorators and annotations named after the great Italian componist Giuseppe Verdi. Like Verdi, it composes things,
but not a great piece of musical history! We compose routes for you. giuseppe is dedicated to
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) and depends on it. We were tired of writing all the route registrations by ourselves.
